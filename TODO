@todo v2
give some optimization space :)
ensure:
1. for dist kv store key codec, in order to Minimize interaction time.

2. support namespace/tenantId(appId/bizId) isolation.

3. key codec add slot, in order to concurrency ttl/gc checker 

optional:
1. add locker feature by using tikv

tips: 
if has used old version key codec online, need some migration tool (clear 88)
